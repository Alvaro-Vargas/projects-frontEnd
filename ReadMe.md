# Projects

Front end built with ReactJS to consume the information of the **Projects** API.

#### Make sure you have the Back-end up and running: [The Back-end / API](https://github.com/Alvaro-Vargas/projects-backend)

### How to run


1. Clone this repo
1. Run `yarn dev` on your terminal <br >
  This will actually run: `webpack-dev-server --mode development`, which will start the webpack server. 
1. Check the application running on: http://localhost:8080/ <br>
  You might want to double check in which port the project is being served. It will be shown in the first lines after running `yarn dev`. 
```
ℹ ｢wds｣: Project is running at http://localhost:8080/
```
